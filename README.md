# Advent Of Code
If time permits, I try to solve some Advent of code (AOC for short) challenges for fun.

AOC can be found at https://adventofcode.com/ and is an annual algorithmic competition held in Decmeber, open to worldwide programmers.

Surely, you will come out as a better programmer after trying out a few of them.
