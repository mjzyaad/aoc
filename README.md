# Advent Of Code
These are my solutions to some of the Advent Of Code (AOC for short) challenges I attempted.

AOC can be found at https://adventofcode.com/ and is an annual algorithmic competition which is open to open to worldwide programmers.  It normally contains a series of 25 questions, whereby a question is published daily for programmers to attempt.  The first puzzle is published on the 1st of December.

Surely, you will come out as a better programmer after trying out a few of them.
